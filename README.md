# loeraflores.com

This is my personal website built with Next.js, Shadcn/UI, and Tailwind CSS.

The current version of my site is in the `site` directory.

All previous versions are in the `legacy` directory which include versions built with SvelteKit and vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

## Local Development

```bash
cd site
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

The site is deployed to Vercel automatically when a PR is merged into main.
